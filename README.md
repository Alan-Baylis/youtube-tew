# youtube-tew

youtube To ElseWhere Â· a simple script to download a video from youtube, save its thumbnail and print its title and description on your terminal.

I wrote it to easily move videos from my YouTube channel to BitChute.

Be sure to get [**youtube-dl**](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/) because this script heavily depends on it.
You should find it quite easily on any Distro, on Arch Linux:

`sudo pacman -S youtube-dl`

Here you'll find 2 versions, the standard one is spiced up with colors by using **tcat**.  
The other is a simplier version that does what you need without any emotions.
