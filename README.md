# youtube-tew

youtube To ElseWhere · a simple script to download a video from youtube, save its thumbnail and print its title and description on your terminal.

I wrote it to easily move videos from my YouTube channel to BitChute.

Here are 2 versions, the standard which is spiced up with colors by using **tcat**.  
The other is a simplier version that does what you need without any emotions.

To get it:

wget 

How to use it:

`. youtube-tew URL`

or make it executable and then:

`./youtube-tew URL`

By default video and thumbnail are saved named with the video title (spaces between words are replaced by _ ) in your *~/Videos/* directory.


Be sure to install [**youtube-dl**](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/) because this script heavily depends on it.  
You should find it quite easily on any Distro, for Arch Linux users:

`sudo pacman -S youtube-dl`
